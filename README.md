# Coly frontend test task
## Goals
Aim of this test to make candidate able to present his skills in a way that would be easy to assess, thus makes [coly.io](https://coly.io) short on feedback and decision making. Candidate will have full freedom over implementation. The only requirements coly stablishes are technologies you would be able to use. Stack is closely related to one we are using for development. The more developed project would be, the higher chances are cangigate would join us.

## Description
Develop the frontend application for showing data about Starwars movies from [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/) by forking this repository.
You would need to implement such interlinked routes as:
- People
- Planets
- Films

For advanced level:
- Species
- Starships
- Vehicles

UX is up to you. You are free to use any styling libraries/ui frameworks. But own build UI is highly appreciated.
To increase score you are welcome to use unit tests or even e2e testing.
git logs will be reviewed as well and we are going to pay extra attention to the code style.

## Techstack 
App should be built using `ReactJS` with `Typescript`. 

You are free to use any underlying framework like [`NextJS`](https://nextjs.org/) or boilerplate like [`CRA`](https://create-react-app.dev/).

For styling we prefer `SASS` over `Tailwind.css`.

Layout transitions and animations are appreciated as well.


_Good luck_
